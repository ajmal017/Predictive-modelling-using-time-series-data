Predictive modelling with time series data
==========================================

This is an example of a predictive modelling task using time series data. The time series data I have used here is stock prices and predictive modelling will help us forecast and/or predict future price action.

This is neither state-of-the-art nor best effort at predictive modelling. This is a toy project and should be treated as such. I hope this project will help those people that would want to get their hands dirty by working on time series data, exploratory analysis & predictive modelling and of course [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)(python).


>> **Note**:
>> * _data_ folder has three files. _dailyPrices\_AtClose.csv_ has closing prices of 56 stocks for 12 months. _X1Signals\_AtClose.csv_ and _X2Signals\_AtClose.csv_ are two exogenous signals 
>> * Repo has html files of each of the jupyter notebooks for sake of completeness. 




Enjoy!
